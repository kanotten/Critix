## About the Project

CritiX is a collaborative project developed by five students as part of their coursework. The platform allows users to explore movies, write reviews, rate films, and engage in discussions about their favorite cinematic experiences. With its sleek design and intuitive functionality, CritiX aims to be a go-to destination for movie enthusiasts.

### User Roles and Access Levels

CritiX has two main sections: **User Section** and **Admin Section**.

- **Public Access**:  
  All visitors can browse movies, read reviews, and view ratings without logging in.

- **User Section**:  
  - Users must log in to create, edit, or delete their own reviews.  
  - Once logged in, users can:  
    - Write and submit reviews for movies.  
    - Edit or delete their own reviews.  
    - Rate movies on a scale of 1 to 10.  

- **Admin Section**:  
  - Admins have full access to manage all content on the platform.  
  - After logging in, admins are redirected to a **dashboard** where they can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on all posts, including:  
    - Adding new movies to the database.  
    - Editing or deleting any movie or review.  
    - Managing user accounts and permissions.  

The separation of roles ensures that regular users can only interact with their own content, while admins have complete control over the platform.

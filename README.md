NOTES!!
Remember to pull before pushing!
Please only push part, component or function to feature. Give a cue or notice when the feature branch is ready and create a
pull request to merge into the production branch.
Remember to code with a cloned repo and not a forked repo. This causes issues with syncing and pulling.

Thank you for your contributions!

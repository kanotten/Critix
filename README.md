NOTES!!

Remember to pull before pushing!
Please only push part, component or function to feature. give a cue or notice on when the feature branch is ready and create a
pull request to merge into production branch.
Remember to code with a cloned repo and not a forked repo. this causes issues with syncing and pulling.

Thank you for your contributions!
